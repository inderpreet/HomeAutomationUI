Web Based Home Automation User Interface
========================================
This project contains the a web based GUI for a home automation system. It is based on a bootstrap based dashboard template which has been modified to suite our needs. There is a lot of JS which run on the client side and my attempt is to create a UI that can be accessed from over the internet to provide a clean view of the Home Automation System. Lots of things still need to be done and it is nowhere near ready for a production environment.
